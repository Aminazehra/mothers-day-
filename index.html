            A mother is the silent strength behind every success story, the first friend we ever know, and the last one to give up on us. She gives without expecting, loves without condition, and carries within her the patience of the earth and the warmth of the sun. Her lullabies become our life's rhythm, her prayers our hidden protection, and her sacrifices the foundation of our dreams. A mother may not wear a cape, but she holds the power to heal with a touch, inspire with a glance, and guide with a heart that knows no bounds. In her embrace, we find home — in her eyes, we find purpose

      <h3>Dear Mom,</h3>
      <p>
        From my first breath, you were my world. You held my hand when I was scared, whispered prayers when I was sick, and gave me the strength to chase dreams. <br><br>
        I still remember how you stayed awake during my exams, quietly brought me kehwa, and reminded me that I could do anything. You made sacrifices I can never repay — only appreciate. <br><br>
        Even now, your wisdom guides me. Your strength lives in me. Thank you for being my light, my comfort, and my forever home. <br><br>
